# MedLens
MedLens is an AI-powered tool built with Streamlit that simplifies complex radiology reports into clear, detailed, and patient-friendly summaries. Designed for non-medical users, MedLens extracts key findings from radiology PDFs and generates easy-to-understand summaries, making medical jargon accessible to everyone.

3.Vector Storage and Retrieval: Chroma and GPT4All embeddings help retrieve and generate contextually relevant summaries using pre-existing medical data.
4.Multi-language Support: Summaries can be translated into regional Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, and more, using GoogleTranslator.
5.Text-to-Speech: Summaries can be read aloud for enhanced accessibility with gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
6.Interactive Chatbot: Users can ask follow-up questions about the report and get simplified answers via LangChain’s RetrievalQA.
